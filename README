Package to provide OCaml client access to Amazon services : S3,
EC2, SQS, SDB, FPS, IAM, DynamoDb, SES.

Aws depends directly on the following packages:

-  netstring
-  cryptokit
-  calendar
-  lwt
-  [xmlm](http://github.com/samoht/xmlm)
-  yojson

It also depends on one of those packages:
-  [cohttp](http://github.com/williamleferrand/ocaml-cohttp) (--enable-cohttp)
-  ocsigen (--enable-ocsigen) (default)

the cohttp driver does not support ssl for now. Some services
(e.g. Ses may no be available when using cohttp)

All of the packages except the last two are available via GODI.
