Package to provide OCaml client access to Amazon services, such as S3,
EC2, SQS, SDB etc.

Aws depends directly on the following packages:

-  lwt
-  [xmlm](http://github.com/samoht/xmlm)
-  [cohttp](http://github.com/williamleferrand/ocaml-cohttp)

All of the packages except the last two are available via GODI.
